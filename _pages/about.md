I am HuYang. I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Resources, Environment and Urban-Rural Planning and Management from Northeast Petroleum University in 2007. In 2010, I obtained a master's degree in Cartography and Geographic Information System from Wuhan University.

I am mainly engaged in work related to photogrammetry, computer vision, and 3D reconstruction. Currently, I am working on 3D reconstruction at Realsee Technology. I possess a range of professional skills, including Structure from Motion, SLAM, Multi-View Stereo, Mesh Reconstruction, and Lidar point cloud processing algorithms.


## Main work

1. 3D reconstruction of indoor and outdoor scenes
Laser Lidar point cloud-based 3D reconstruction. This includes pose estimation (SfM), point cloud registration, point cloud processing, mesh reconstruction, mesh processing (simplification, smoothing, sharpening), texture mapping, and LOD generation.
Image-based outdoor scene 3D reconstruction (oblique photography). This involves image SfM, MVS algorithms, point cloud processing, mesh reconstruction, mesh processing (simplification, smoothing, sharpening), texture mapping, and LOD generation.
2. Indoor scene house type analysis and structured reconstruction
House type analysis and generation of floor plans.
This includes extracting structures (walls, floors, ceilings) and reconstructing them.
3. Handheld laser SLAM
Includes SLAM, point cloud processing (point cloud filtering, normal vector estimation, dynamic object removal, etc.), point cloud coloring, and color equalization.
4. Photogrammetry software
Includes generating dense point clouds, generating DSM and DEM. Point cloud filtering of airborne laser Lidar (classification of ground points and non-ground points), and vectorized reconstruction of buildings (individualization).
5. 3D reconstruction algorithm for aerial images
This includes SfM, MVS, mesh generation, LOD, and more.
